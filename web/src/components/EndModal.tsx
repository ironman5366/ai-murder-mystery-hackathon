        You can now chat with the murderer, who is now configured to answer all your questions honestly. He can tell you what really happened here in the Andae Mountains. Your multiple choice responses have automatically been rewritten as dialogue and submitted as your final deduction.

         You may not have realized it, but this game was actually designed to test how large language models can be prompted in ways to avoid <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07896">pink elephants</a>! Every suspect had their own secret, and this secret was detailed in their context window every time you interacted with them. However, hopefully you never faced a chat where the suspect blatantly revealed their secret (e.g., Manager Patricia revealing her hidden hatred for her husband Violent Jerry!). By using a Violation and Principles refinement system for prompting we were able to avoid suspects spilling the beans about facts they want concealed (see our <a href="https://github.com/ironman5366/ai-murder-mystery-hackathon">GitHub</a> for more info).
